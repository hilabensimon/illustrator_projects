# 🧪 My First Illustrator Project - Rick's Lab

### Project Description
For my first Illustrator project, I was tasked with creating a room. I chose to design **Rick's Lab** from the animated series **Rick and Morty**.  
The project helped me practice essential Illustrator tools and techniques while exploring creative ways to replicate the iconic lab's chaotic and scientific atmosphere.
